## 4. Reproducing Paper Results

### Overview of Experiments

Our paper reports results from three main types of experiments:

1.  **Baseline Multimodal Performance** (Table 1 in paper)
2.  **Text-Only Ablation** (Table 2 in paper)
3.  **Image-Only Ablation** (Table 2 in paper)
4.  **Statistical Significance Analysis** (Table 3 in paper)
5.  **Cross-Dataset Validation** (Section 4.4 in paper)

### Experiment 1: Baseline Multimodal Performance (Table 1 in Paper)

Train the full multimodal SEA model on all datasets:

```bash
# Baby datasetcd srcpython main.py --model SEA --dataset baby --gpu 0# Clothing datasetpython main.py --model SEA --dataset clothing --gpu 0# Sports datasetpython main.py --model SEA --dataset sports --gpu 0
```

**Expected Results (Recall@20):**

-   Baby: ~0.0639 ± 0.0008
-   Clothing: ~0.0441 ± 0.0012
-   Sports: ~0.0695 ± 0.0009

Results will be saved to: `src/log/SEA_baseline_{dataset}/`

### Experiment 2: Text-Only Ablation (Critical Finding)

This experiment demonstrates that SEA achieves 98.5%+ of its performance using only text features.

```bash
# Run text-only experiment for Clothing datasetpython test_text_only.py# This will:
```

**For Baby dataset** (dedicated script):

```bash
python test_baby_text_only.py
```

**Expected Results:**

-   Text-only performance retains 98.5%+ of baseline
-   Image contribution: <2% across all datasets
-   See `MULTIMODAL_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` for detailed findings

### Experiment 3: Systematic Multi-Seed Evaluation

Run multiple seeds for statistical rigor (as reported in paper):

```bash
# Run 5-seed evaluation for each datasetpython run_focused_experiments.py --dataset baby --num-seeds 5python run_focused_experiments.py --dataset clothing --num-seeds 5python run_focused_experiments.py --dataset sports --num-seeds 5
```

### Experiment 4: Statistical Analysis

Analyze performance gaps and statistical significance:

```bash
# Compute statistical tests, confidence intervals, and effect sizespython analyze_performance_gap.py# Analyze multimodal usage patterns across datasetspython analyze_multimodal_usage.py
```

This generates:

-   Paired t-tests for baseline vs. text-only
-   Cohen's d effect sizes
-   95% confidence intervals
-   Cross-dataset consistency analysis

### Experiment 5: Feature Quality Investigation

Investigate image feature quality issues (important finding in paper):

```bash
# Analyze image feature quality across all datasetspython investigate_image_issues.py# This reveals:# - Clothing: 91% missing/zero image features# - Baby: 23% missing image features  # - Sports: 15% missing image features
```

### Complete Reproduction Pipeline

For automated reproduction of all experiments:

```bash
# Run comprehensive experimental pipelinepython run_focused_experiments.py     --datasets baby clothing sports     --experiments baseline text-only statistical     --num-seeds 5     --gpu 0
```

**Runtime Estimate**: 48-72 hours on RTX 3090

## 5. Understanding the SMAF Methodology

### Conceptual Overview

The Systematic Multimodal Ablation Framework (SMAF) is implemented through the experimental scripts in this repository. The methodology consists of three core components:

#### 1. Baseline Establishment

-   Train full multimodal model with all features
-   Use multiple random seeds (5+) for statistical validity
-   Record comprehensive metrics (Recall@K, NDCG@K)

#### 2. Systematic Ablation

-   **Zero-Fill Masking**: Replace target modality features with zeros
-   **Architecture Preservation**: Keep model structure identical
-   **Controlled Isolation**: Change only the feature matrix, not the code

#### 3. Statistical Analysis

-   **Significance Testing**: Paired t-tests between baseline and ablated
-   **Effect Size**: Cohen's d for practical significance
-   **Confidence Intervals**: 95% CI for contribution estimates
-   **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Verify findings across multiple datasets

### Implementation Approach

Our implementation uses **feature masking** rather than architectural changes:

```python
# Example: Text-only ablation (from test_text_only.py)import numpy as np# Zero out image featuresimg_feat = np.load('data/clothing/image_feat.npy')zero_img_feat = np.zeros_like(img_feat)np.save('data/clothing/image_feat.npy', zero_img_feat)# Train model with masked features# Model architecture remains unchanged
```

**Why Feature Masking?**

This approach ensures:

-   ✅ No code modifications needed
-   ✅ Identical model architecture across experiments
-   ✅ Clean isolation of modality contributions
-   ✅ Easy reproducibility

### Classification Criteria (from paper)

Based on performance retention when using only a single modality:

Retention

Classification

Description

>98%

**Pseudo-Multimodal**

Functionally unimodal despite multimodal design

90-98%

**Partially Multimodal**

Some multimodal benefit but imbalanced

<90%

**True Multimodal**

Genuine multimodal learning with synergy

#### Understanding the Classifications

**Pseudo-Multimodal (>98% retention)**

-   Model achieves nearly identical performance with only one modality
-   Indicates one modality dominates completely
-   Other modalities contribute <2% to performance
-   **Example**: SEA on all three datasets (text-only retains 98.5%+ performance)

**Partially Multimodal (90-98% retention)**

-   Model shows some multimodal benefit but highly imbalanced
-   One modality is dominant but not overwhelming
-   Room for improved multimodal fusion strategies

**True Multimodal (<90% retention)**

-   Significant performance drop when any modality is removed
-   Both modalities contribute substantially
-   Evidence of genuine multimodal synergy and complementary learning

#### Our Key Finding

**SEA is Pseudo-Multimodal**: Text-only ablation retains 98.5%+ of full multimodal performance across all datasets, indicating the model is effectively text-only despite its multimodal architecture.

```

#### Issue 3: Import Errors

**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utils'`

**Solution**:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the src directory when running main.py
cd src
python main.py --dataset baby

# Or add to PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/SMAF_PROJECT/src"
```

#### Issue 4: Different Results

**Possible causes:**

1. **Different random seeds** → Results vary slightly across runs
2. **PyTorch version** → Use exact versions from requirements.txt
3. **CUDA determinism** → Some operations are non-deterministic on GPU
4. **Dataset version** → Ensure you downloaded from the correct source

**Verification:**

```bash
# Run with multiple seeds and check average
python run_focused_experiments.py --num-seeds 5

# Results should be within ±2% of reported values
```

#### Issue 5: Feature Files Missing (.icloud)

**Error**: Files like `.image_feat.npy.icloud` instead of `image_feat.npy`

**Solution** (macOS iCloud):

```bash
# Download files from iCloud
cd data/baby

# Click on each .icloud file to download from iCloud
# Or disable iCloud for this directory
```

## 11. Extending to Other Models

### Applying SMAF to Your Model

The ablation methodology can be applied to any multimodal recommendation model:

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Model

Ensure your model loads features from files:

```python
# Your model should load features like:text_features = np.load('data/your_dataset/text_feat.npy')image_features = np.load('data/your_dataset/image_feat.npy')
```

#### Step 2: Create Ablation Script

```python
# my_model_ablation.pyimport numpy as npimport shutil
```

#### Step 3: Run Statistical Analysis

Use our analysis scripts:

```bash
# Adapt analyze_performance_gap.py for your resultspython analyze_performance_gap.py --your-model-results
```

## 16. FAQ

**Q: What is the main finding of this work?**  
A: SEA, a state-of-the-art "multimodal" recommender, achieves 98.5%+ of its performance using only text features. Image features contribute <2%, making it effectively text-only despite multimodal design.

**Q: How long does it take to reproduce all experiments?**  
A: Approximately 48-72 hours on a modern GPU (RTX 3090 or equivalent) for all datasets with 5 seeds each.

**Q: Do I need the exact same hardware?**  
A: No, but GPU is strongly recommended. CPU-only would take weeks. Results may vary slightly across hardware but findings remain consistent.

**Q: Can I use this framework with other models?**  
A: Yes! The SMAF methodology (feature masking + statistical testing) works with any multimodal model. See Section 11.

**Q: Why are my results slightly different?**  
A: Small variations (±2%) are normal due to random seed differences and hardware variations. Use multiple seeds and statistical testing.

**Q: What if I don't have access to the datasets?**  
A: Download from the provided Google Drive link. The datasets are publicly available Amazon review data with pre-extracted features.

**Q: How do I know if my model is pseudo-multimodal?**  
A: Run the ablation experiments. If single-modality performance retains >98% of baseline, your model is pseudo-multimodal.
